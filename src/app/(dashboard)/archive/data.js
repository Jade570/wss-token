If the most recent disaster - the Aricell battery factory fire - has revealed the safety hazards that migrant workers, a group that is not well represented in Korea, must endure, then the hatred faced by the queer community in Korea also falls under a similar hazard. Furthermore, I am reminded of Sergeant Byun Hui-su, a close friend of my friends, who was forcibly discharged after her gender transition. Here, in the final color, red, I wish to encapsulate both my story and Sergeant Byun Hui-su's story, to speak of the pain experienced by Koreans, and queer Koreans, living in these times, the most heartfelt wishes that bloom from that pain, and the love that is built on that foundation.",

We all wished that this would be the last ribbon. However, in 2018, when I entered university in Seoul, I once visited Gwanghwamun. There, alongside the familiar yellow ribbons, I was handed keychains bearing orange ribbons for the Stellar Daisy ferry disaster. How could I have been unaware of this event - the incident happened in March 2017. In 2017, I was in my final year of high school, focusing on my College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), and the nation was in turmoil with the presidential impeachment and early presidential election. Perhaps for those reasons, this incident was quietly buried in my memory.",

My parents, deciding that I needed to prepare for high school and university, sent me to a math academy, and I remember coming home after studying past 9 o’clock for the first time. Those days passed with the internet’s real-time search rankings and television screens unchanged—that was the day of the Sewol ferry disaster. I clearly recall that on the first day, it was said that everyone had been rescued. However, over the following days, the truth slowly emerged, and the supposed full rescue was revealed to be a blatant lie… I remember the countless citizen volunteers and divers.

The KTX is usually considered seriously delayed if it’s more than 10 minutes behind schedule, but that day, with roads flooding in various areas, the KTX I was scheduled to take was delayed by 33 minutes. A landmark supermarket in Cheonan was also flooded, and for several days I couldn’t get to work in Seoul. For me, that memory is filled with both dread and annoyance. And that summer, 2023, felt similar - with heavy rains and signs of impending flooding. Soon after, I heard of another fatal accident nearby. It wasn’t long before I learned that the bus, which became the representative image of that tragedy, was the very same bus that my friend frequently rode.",

During that conversation, my friend told me that this tragedy might have hit me harder as someone living overseas. In fact, I thought the opposite; I believed it wasn’t directly related to my life unlike the other disasters.
