    sound:"This sound was recorded by a friend who lives in the same apartment complex as I do in Korea. Right in front of the complex is the small elementary school that we both attended, so on weekdays, when you step outside, you can hear children running and playing mixed with the chirping of birds. There’s also a road just beyond it, so you hear all kinds of cars passing by, and at times even strange helicopter noises. I moved to this neighborhood in Cheonan one year after I was born, and until I went to university in Seoul, I never once left this area. My friend is the same. In other words, it’s a neighborhood holding about nineteen years of memories. Some are painful, some joyful, but surely there is something unchanging in that elementary school we went to and in the neighborhood where we’ve both lived almost our whole lives.",

    sound:"This sound was recorded while I was riding the KTX to Seoul. When you board the KTX, you hear a strange, somewhat high-pitched hum—wooo—resonating through the train. That uncanny tone, coupled with the feeling of “I’m really heading to Seoul, I’m traveling somewhere,” both excites me and fills me with a certain anxiety. The KTX is incredibly fast and comfortable, yet this artificial tone cutting through the tense quiet of crowded public spaces in Korea seems to amplify that unease. Sometimes that sound brings a spoonful of excitement, other times it adds a spoonful of anxiety and sadness—of course, it all depends on my mood. Surely, on those first days when I took the KTX to Seoul for university, there was only that blissful ignorance, unable to share in the world’s sorrow.",

We all wished that this would be the last ribbon. However, in 2018, when I entered university in Seoul, I once visited Gwanghwamun. There, alongside the familiar yellow ribbons, I was handed keychains bearing orange ribbons for the Stellar Daisy ferry disaster. How could I have been unaware of this event - the incident happened in March 2017. In 2017, I was in my final year of high school, focusing on my College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), and the nation was in turmoil with the presidential impeachment and early presidential election. Perhaps for those reasons, this incident was quietly buried in my memory.",

    sound:"Being 25 years old, some of my friends have already found jobs or are preparing to enter the workforce, and others—like me—are attending or preparing for graduate school. A few are still undergraduates, and several more are studying for high‑stakes national certification exams, such as the civil service exam (고시). This is the sound a friend of mine—who’s preparing for one of those exams—recorded while studying in our university library. Most Korean universities provide reading rooms that are kept extremely quiet exclusively for students tackling these major exams, and my friend is using one right now. If the Danwon High School seniors who perished in the Sewol ferry disaster hadn’t been caught up in that tragedy, they too would probably have been enjoying this slightly strange, utterly silent space while studying for their futures.",

At that time, I was in my third year of middle school and already known as a problematic student who was overly addicted to games. My parents, deciding that I needed to prepare for high school and university, sent me to a math academy, and I remember coming home after studying past 9 o’clock for the first time. Those days passed with the internet’s real-time search rankings and television screens unchanged—that was the day of the Sewol ferry disaster. I clearly recall that on the first day, it was said that everyone had been rescued. However, over the following days, the truth slowly emerged, and the supposed full rescue was revealed to be a blatant lie… I remember the countless citizen volunteers and divers. This has become a collective trauma for our generation.",

    sound:"I like staying at home, but one of my friends loves traveling. They have a keener sense for sound than I do and often record various noises. This is a recording they made at Eulsukdo. Because I lived in Korea all my life, I never thought any of the sounds around me were particularly special. But when I came here to Atlanta, I felt something was missing from the soundscape. One of those things seems to be the chorus of insects. Listening to this recording my friend gave me, it’s perhaps not surprising that the insect sounds—more than the birdsong or the recording itself—are what I miss most. Will we be able to carry these beautiful natural sounds of each place, and nature itself, with us until the very end?",

The KTX is usually considered seriously delayed if it’s more than 10 minutes behind schedule, but that day, with roads flooding in various areas, the KTX I was scheduled to take was delayed by 33 minutes. A landmark supermarket in Cheonan was also flooded, and for several days I couldn’t get to work in Seoul. For me, that memory is filled with both dread and annoyance. And that summer, 2023, felt similar - with heavy rains and signs of impending flooding. Soon after, I heard of another fatal accident nearby. It wasn’t long before I learned that the bus, which became the representative image of that tragedy, was the very same bus that my friend frequently rode.",

But when one of my friends suggested that I must have felt a lot about this accident, I felt ashamed. What made this incident especially striking was that the victims were migrant workers—and it laid bare the shamefully poor human‑rights protections and labor laws for migrant workers in Korea. I am living abroad myself; how could I possibly alienate them? This is a sound I recorded here in Atlanta. In the first part you’ll hear birdsong, and in the second part the sound of the road blends in.",

      text: "While I was studying abroad during a vacation and resting in Korea, I heard news of a major fire in Hwaseong. It was an electrical fire caused by lithium batteries, and most of the casualties were foreign laborers. This catastrophe was the result of a confluence of rampant negligence, shortcuts, and illegal practices - a result of the “risk outsourcing”. If one were to consider only the outsourcing of dangerous tasks through subcontracting, then the Aricell disaster goes even further by highlighting that this outsourcing has spread internationally to migrant workers. \n \n There was a time when, while talking about disasters with a friend, I felt so embarrassed that I couldn’t even lift my head. During that conversation, my friend told me that this tragedy might have hit me harder as someone living overseas. In fact, I thought the opposite; I believed it wasn’t directly related to my life unlike the other disasters. And even though I live as a foreigner myself, how much had I been otherizing that tragedy? How short-sighted I was to otherize the victims – mostly the emigrant workers – as the tragedy itself started from outsourcing, or rather, otherizing them?",

And stations are always crowded. Both Seoulites and people from the provinces spill out voices and sounds full of their dreams, their excitement, and every other emotion. Especially at Yongsan Station, the nearby department stores and shopping districts blast loud music. So if you sit there quietly, it feels chaotic, yet you realize, “This is where people live—this is our country’s biggest city.” That same evening in Itaewon, young people with those feelings had gathered—and the state literally let them die while turning its back on them...",
