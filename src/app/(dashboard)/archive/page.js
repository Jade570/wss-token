The tragedies of 21st-century Korea include the Sewol ferry disaster, followed by the Stellar Daisy ferry incident, the Itaewon tragedy, the Osong underpass tragedy, and the Aricell battery factory fire. These were all catastrophic events in which countless people lost their lives - disasters that could have been prevented, should never have occurred, and were all caused by human actions.
